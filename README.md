# Blocked_Valley_Lake_Poyang
These two codes compute the incipient formation of a tributary blocked valley lake. The lake forms in response to the base level rise. The model has two key parts: the 1D backwater equations of shallow water flow and the Exner equation of sediment conservation. The code “BlockedValleyLakes” applies a dimensional formulation, and the code “BlockedValleyLakes_dimensionless” applies a dimensionless formulation.
